## General Information
- Sanitation and Hygiene monitoring system for public toilets
is the need of time to keep a track on the public toilets in
urban areas. The smart system should be able to efficiently
monitor the hygiene of the toilet and send timely alerts if
the condition of the toilet worsens. 
- With Embedded system gaining popularity now-a-days; its
applications can be deployed to provide service to improve
the standard of living of people living in urban slums. The
real time sensing of various parameters like air quality,
water availability etc. of public toilets will instruct the
system to take actions according to the current status of the
toilet and thus maintain the usability and hygienic
conditions.
- There are many existing e-toilets, but the
proposed system ensures accurate and cost-effective
solution and is based on the technology that has a wide
scope in the long run
- The system also has a backup wherein if there is a failure to
respond to the alert message generated; the toilet gets cleaned
up by triggering the actuators installed.

## Features
- The timely monitoring of the public toilet and a regular track on the
   sweeperâ€™s work is the key feature of the proposed system. 
- The system also has a backup wherein if there is a failure to
  respond to the alert message generated; the toilet gets cleaned
  up by triggering the actuators installed. 
- The system was meticulously tested in large number of
  public toilets including the worst-case conditions and the
  parameters were measured.
